# Liyu-Andaynet-Game
I used to play the game Liyu Andaynet when I was a child in Ethiopia. 
It's a game that two players play to decide who gets to pick or who gets to be first in anything.
The game is easy. To start, select between Andaynet and Liyu. While andaynet means the same, liyu means different. Afterward, you throw your palm side or your front side of your hand.
If you chose andaynet/the same and Â both you and the other person throw palm side or front side of your hand you win if not you lose.
Its the same for the other option if you chose liyu/different and one throw palm side and the other throw front side you win if its the same the other person wins.
